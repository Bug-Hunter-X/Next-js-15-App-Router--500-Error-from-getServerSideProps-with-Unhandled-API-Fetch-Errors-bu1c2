In Next.js 15, an uncommon error can occur when using the `app` directory and server components with `async` functions within the `getServerSideProps` function.  The issue arises when these functions rely on data fetched from an external API and don't handle potential network errors or timeouts gracefully.  If the API call fails, the server component might crash, leading to a 500 Internal Server Error, without providing meaningful information in the error logs or the user interface.
